Legend had it that this phantom was a playful spirit left behind by the forgotten tokens and dormant wallets of Solana's early days. It's said that the phantom wandered the Solana blockchain, yearning for purpose and waiting for the right moment to reveal itself.",
    "During the Halloween of 2024, as market volatility spiked, strange transactions began appearing in users' wallets, labeled only as $Haunt. At first, the community dismissed them as random glitches, but soon eerie messages began surfacing in decentralized forums. \"You've been Haunted!\" they read, always accompanied by tiny fractions of the mysterious token.",
